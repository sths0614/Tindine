# DineSum
DineSum is an Android app that will be able to make the pre-dining experience less stressful by helping diners save precious waiting time when going to popular restaurants. DineSum allows users to make requests for “reservations”, which consists of specifying a restaurant, a time range for the customer to be entered into the waiting queue, and a party name and number. As further incentive, each
request is worth a user-specified monetary value, which will be paid from the requester to the reserver after the requester is seated at the restaurant.
